# Image Generation and Manipulation 

- In this repository, it is aimed to conduct various experimentation to test and leverage image generation models in order to study their capabilities. 

- The image generation models are experimented on [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- Please go through the setup instructions in the aforementioned repository.

- Please note that for different image generation or manipulation objectives, we may use different custom nodes. 
- The nodes may be installed directly through [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager) or manually through their respective repositories.

- This project will be structured according to the different use cases we encounter during image generation or manipulation tasks.
- With that said let's dive into Image Generation with ComfyUI!!
